I mostly consulted the resources that were posted in the assignment, like documentation for certain JavaScript functions. However, I also looked up simple things like the syntax for things like "foreach" in JavaScript, where the exact resource I consulted doesn't really matter).
Another thing I looked up was how to add a listener to button presses, where I used the top result to guide me.

I also used Vega documentation to sort my graphs better: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/sort.html
I also used this documentation to add some listeners: https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/putting-it-all-together/events-and-listeners
