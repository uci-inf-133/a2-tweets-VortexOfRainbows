1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
- 4/4 Identifying the most popular activities
- 3/3 Adding a text search interface

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I would guess it took me about 6.5 hours to complete this assignment

3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)

I mostly consulted the resources that were posted in the assignment, like documentation for certain JavaScript functions. However, I also looked up simple things like the syntax for things like "foreach" in JavaScript, where the exact resource I consulted doesn't really matter).
Another thing I looked up was how to add a listener to button presses, where I used the top result to guide me.

I also used Vega documentation to sort my graphs better: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/sort.html
I also used this documentation to add some listeners: https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/putting-it-all-together/events-and-listeners
I also used this documentation on inserting rows into DOM table: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_table_insertrow.asp

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not consult any classmates for this assignment, nor did I consult anyone else.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

I used some algorithms to find out the most popular activity rather than hardcoding it, but the outcomes should still be accurate (maybe it will load slower?)
