3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)

I mostly consulted the resources that were posted in the assignment, like documentation for certain JavaScript functions. However, I also looked up simple things like the syntax for things like "foreach" in JavaScript, where the exact resource I consulted doesn't really matter (I already knew how to do what was needed, but am unfamiliar with JS syntax in particular)
Another thing I looked up was how to add a listener to button presses, where I used the top result to guide me.

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?



5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
